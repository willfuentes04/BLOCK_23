# PuppyBowl

Welcome to PuppyBowl!

## Getting Started

1. Live serve `index.html`. The website should be blank!
1. Read through the comments of each function in `script.js` to get a sense of what this website should do once completed. **Do not** start writing code!
1. Read the example test specs in `script.test.js` for `fetchAllPlayers`.

## Instructions

1. In `script.test.js`, use `describe` to add test specs for `fetchSinglePlayer` and `addNewPlayer`.
   - Each `describe` should contain _at least_ one `test`.
2. (Optional) Write tests for `removePlayer` as well.
   - _Hint: How would you test a function with no return value?_
3. Complete the API functions in `script.js` so all test cases pass when you run `npm test`.
4. Once all tests pass, complete the rest of the functions in `script.js`.
   - The render functions should change what you see when you live serve `index.html`.
